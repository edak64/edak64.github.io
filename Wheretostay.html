<p>What makes Lebanon such a great country is unlike other countries you can only travel to one region at a time here you can visit a lot of region in a day.
why not go skiing in the morning and swim at the beach in the afternoon and what does that help you in you can choose the hotel of your liking anywhere and not be obliged
to take into consideration transport hardship for example you can make your reservation in a hotel in Beirut and go to Zahle in just an hour or vise-versa </p>
